## Welcome to 'Reconstructing Transmission with Genomic Data' at SISMID 2022

This site hosts all of the materials for the course. 

For more details see [our module page on the SISMID website](https://si.biostat.washington.edu/about/sismid/MD2210).

### Schedule

The schedule is [available here](https://jessicastockdale.github.io/SISMID2022-transmission-genomics/Files/Mod10_schedule.pdf).

### Things to know

- The module will be delivered through a combination of pre-recorded video lectures and live sessions. The best option is to follow along in sync with the schedule. However, we realize that some of you are in time zones where this is more difficult, so we have tried to design the course such that you can make adjustments if need be. All live sessions will be recorded and made available to module participants.

- Most organization will be done through our module Slack channel; here you will find the live session and recording Zoom links. Please email us or SISMID if you have not been added to the Slack by the start of the course. We will also have a second channel, #m10_questions_answers, for you to post questions about any of the module content. We'll be answering these questions during the 'Open work and discussion' sessions (see below).

- We will have the Zoom meeting open ~15 minutes before and after each scheduled day, if you want to come and chat with your fellow participants. The meeting will also remain open during all of the breaks.

- 'Open work and discussion' sessions will be informal time for Q&A, discussion, catching up on any incomplete exercises: you can use this time as you best see fit. We'll use the main Zoom room for Q&A, and can open up breakout rooms for anyone wanting to work together on the exercises. 


### Module Preparation

All computational exercises in this module will use R and Rstudio.

If you've never used R before, we have created a tutorial for you to work through in advance of the course. If you've already done a tutorial for one of the other SISMID modules or otherwise, that will be fine too. You can access the tutorial here: [An Introduction to R and RStudio](https://jessicastockdale.github.io/SISMID2022-transmission-genomics/Files/R_tutorial.html).

We have also created a short second R tutorial which walks you through installing all of the packages we'll be using during the module. Please work through this in advance of the course. If you have any problems, feel free to drop us a message on Slack. The second tutorial can be accessed here: [Installation and preparation instructions](https://jessicastockdale.github.io/SISMID2022-transmission-genomics/Files/R_tutorial2.html). **Note: everyone should do this one!**
